    Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)

    Symptoms

    Some people infected by HIV get a flu-like illness within 2 to 4 weeks after the virus enters the body. This stage may last a few days to several weeks. Some people have no symptoms during this stage.
    Possible symptoms include:
    Fever.
    Headache.
    Muscle aches and joint pain.
    Rash.
    Sore throat and painful mouth sores.
    Swollen lymph glands, also called nodes, mainly on the neck.
    Diarrhoea.
    Weight loss.
    Cough.
    Night sweats.
    Diabetes
    Diabetes

    Some of the symptoms of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes are:

    Feeling more thirsty than usual.
    Urinating often.
    Losing weight without trying.
    Presence of ketones in the urine. Ketones are a byproduct of the breakdown of muscle and fat that happens when there's not enough available insulin.
    Feeling tired and weak.
    Feeling irritable or having other mood changes.
    Having blurry vision.
    Having slow-healing sores.
    Getting a lot of infections, such as gum, skin and vaginal infections.
    Sexually transmitted infection (STI’s)
    STI symptoms might include:
    Sores or bumps on the genitals or in the oral or rectal area.
    Painful or burning urination.
    Discharge from the penis.
    Unusual or odorous vaginal discharge.
    Unusual vaginal bleeding.
    Pain during sex.
    Sore, swollen lymph nodes, particularly in the groin but sometimes more widespread.
    Lower abdominal pain.
    Fever.
    Rash over the trunk, hands or feet.
